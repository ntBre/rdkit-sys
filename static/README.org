the goal of this subdirectory is to figure out how to statically link to RDKit.
The steps I see are

1. [X] Hello world in C++ with normal, dynamic link
2. [ ] Hello world in C++ statically linked
3. [ ] Statically linked C binary
4. [ ] Statically linked Rust

There could also be a step 2.5 where I build a dynamically linked C binary, but
I hope not to need that after a successful step 2.
